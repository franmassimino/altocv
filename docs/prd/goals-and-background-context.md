# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Based on your Project Brief, here are the key desired outcomes for this PRD:

- **Deliver a functional CV creation and adaptation platform** that demonstrates modern full-stack capabilities (Next.js 15, AI integration, payments) within 12 weeks
- **Create a portfolio-worthy project** showcasing technical depth in AI/ML integration, conversational interfaces, and real-world problem solving
- **Build a tool you actually use** to create and adapt CVs, validated by 2-3 friends who can use it independently
- **Implement core differentiation features**: conversational AI editor, ATS analysis, and smart import from LinkedIn/PDF
- **Deploy to production** with clean code architecture, responsive design, and at least one functional template
- **Maintain operational simplicity** with <$50/month costs and low-touch maintenance post-launch

## Background Context

AltocV2 addresses a critical pain point in the modern job search: the fragmented, time-intensive process of creating and adapting CVs that pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Currently, 75% of CVs never reach human eyes due to automatic rejection, and professionals waste 15-20 hours per month manually adapting their CVs for different roles without knowing if they're using the right keywords or format.

Traditional CV builders offer pretty templates but no intelligence about content or ATS optimization. AI tools like ChatGPT require complex prompts and aren't integrated into the editing workflow. AltocV2 bridges this gap by combining conversational AI that edits in real-time, ATS analysis trained on real data, intelligent import from LinkedIn/PDFs, and industry-specialized templates. This is a 3-month portfolio project demonstrating competence in modern AI-powered SaaS development, with the dual benefit of creating a tool that solves a real problem you personally experience.
