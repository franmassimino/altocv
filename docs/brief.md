**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-01-09
**Author**: Francisco
**Project Type**: Personal Portfolio Project

---

## Executive Summary

AltocV2 is a web platform that revolutionizes CV creation and adaptation through a conversational AI assistant that understands how hiring systems actually work. Unlike traditional editors, AltocV2 combines an integrated chat that edits in real-time, ATS analysis based on real data, intelligent import from LinkedIn and job postings, advanced tone/style personalization, and industry-specialized visual templates.

**The main problem it solves:** (1) friction and time wasted manually adapting CVs, (2) difficulty articulating experience effectively, (3) the "black hole" of not knowing if your CV will pass ATS filters, and (4) the disconnect between LinkedIn profiles, existing CVs, and new applications.

**Key value proposition:**
- **Conversational AI Editor**: Integrated chat that modifies your CV in real-time - you speak naturally, AI edits on visual templates
- **ATS Reality Check**: AI engine trained with real ATS system data that analyzes compatibility and offers one-click fixes
- **Job Match Intelligence**: Automatic analysis of job postings with compatibility score and specific suggestions
- **Smart Import**: Intelligent scraping of LinkedIn, job postings, and existing CVs (PDF) for auto-population
- **Adaptive Writing Assistant**: Tone and style control (formal/casual, technical/accessible) with industry presets
- **Industry-Smart Templates**: Visual templates (not markdown) that understand structure and priorities by sector
- **Effortless Workflow**: Notion-style continuous auto-save, multi-format export, and sharing analytics

**Key differentiator**: The only CV builder where you converse with an AI that truly understands what ATS look for and can read/import from any source.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

**The traditional process of creating and adapting CVs is fragmented, inefficient, and frustrating:**

**For experienced professionals:**
- They have 3-5 versions of their CV in different folders, not knowing which is the most recent
- Adapting a CV for each offer takes 30-60 minutes of manual copy/paste/reformatting
- They don't know if they're using the right keywords that automatic systems look for
- Feedback is non-existent until they (don't) get a response weeks later

**For people with difficulty articulating:**
- They know what they've done, but don't know how to "sell it" professionally
- Generic templates don't help with content, only with format
- Hiring someone to write your CV costs $100-500 USD
- They feel their experience looks "flat" compared to other candidates

**For all users:**
- **ATS black hole**: 75% of CVs never reach human eyes, automatically rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems
- **Data disconnect**: Information already exists on LinkedIn, old CVs, portfolios - but must be manually rewritten
- **Format anxiety**: PDF or Word? One page or two? What font passes filters?
- **Lack of context**: Current tools don't understand the specific offer you're applying to

### Quantifiable Impact

- **Time wasted**: Professionals in active search invest 15-20 hours/month just adapting CVs
- **Opportunity cost**: 60% of qualified candidates are rejected by poorly optimized CVs for ATS, not lack of skills
- **Economic barrier**: Professional CV services are out of reach for 80% of job seekers
- **Emotional stress**: 67% of job seekers report significant anxiety about their CV quality

### Why Existing Solutions Fail

**Traditional editors (Word, Google Docs):**
- Zero intelligence about content
- Inconsistent formatting between versions
- No ATS optimization

**Generic CV Builders (Canva, Resume.io):**
- Pretty templates but generic content
- Don't analyze compatibility with specific jobs
- Rigid and limited editing experience

**AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude):**
- Require complex prompts and multiple iterations
- Not integrated into editing workflow
- No specialized knowledge in ATS
- User has to copy/paste between tools

**LinkedIn:**
- Format not exportable to traditional CV
- No ability to adapt for different roles
- Doesn't analyze compatibility with offers

### Urgency and Importance

**Market timing:**
- The 2025 job market is more competitive than ever (average 200+ applicants per position)
- ATS systems become more sophisticated but less transparent
- Generative AI changed expectations - users know it should be easier
- Remote work expanded global competition - you need to stand out more

**Window of opportunity:**
- Users are adopting AI for work (ChatGPT has 200M+ active users)
- Growing frustration with existing tools that haven't evolved
- Willingness to pay for tools that truly save time

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

AltocV2 is a **career conversational assistant** that combines the fluidity of AI chat, the reliability of a professional editor, and the intelligence of specialized recruitment systems. It's not just a CV editor - it's your personal coach that understands both your professional story and the systems that will evaluate your CV.

### Solution Approach

**1. Conversation as Primary Interface**
Instead of facing an empty editor, you start a natural conversation:
- "Help me adapt my CV for this Product Manager offer at Google"
- AI reads the offer (via scraping or paste), analyzes your current CV, and suggests specific changes
- Modifications apply in real-time on the visual editor
- Direct editing always available - chat complements, doesn't replace control

**2. ATS Intelligence Based on Real Data**
AI engine specifically trained with:
- Patterns from real ATS systems (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, etc.)
- Analysis of which CVs pass filters and which don't
- Keywords and formats that maximize compatibility
- Actionable feedback: "Your CV has 67% match. Adding 'Python' in Skills would increase to 85%"

**3. Intelligent Import from Any Source**
Eliminates reinventing the wheel:
- **LinkedIn scraping**: One click to import your complete profile
- **Job posting analysis**: Paste the offer link, AI extracts requirements
- **PDF parsing**: Upload your previous CV, transcribes and structures automatically
- **Smart merge**: Combines information from multiple sources coherently

**4. Intelligent Templates by Industry**
Not just "pretty", but structurally optimized:
- Template "Tech Startup": Prioritizes projects and tech stack over formal education
- Template "Corporate/Finance": Emphasis on quantifiable achievements and progression
- Template "Creative": Balance between portfolio links and experience
- Each template understands which sections matter most in that context

**5. Adaptive Writing Assistant**
Fine control over how you present yourself:
- Personality sliders: Formal ↔ Casual, Technical ↔ Accessible, Concise ↔ Detailed
- Industry presets that adjust entire tone automatically
- Real-time preview of style changes
- AI rewrites maintaining your achievements but adjusting the "voice"

**6. Cloud-First with Auto-Save**
Modern Notion-style experience:
- All your CVs in one cloud workspace
- Continuous auto-save (never lose changes)
- Automatic versioning with timestamps
- Duplicate and adapt in seconds, not minutes

**7. Export & Share Intelligence**
- Multi-format: PDF (ATS-friendly), Word, LinkedIn format, plain text
- Preview of how it looks on different devices
- Sharing links with analytics: did they open it? how long?
- ATS compatibility score before exporting

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

**Perfect technology timing:**
- Current LLMs are good enough for contextual conversation
- Web scraping and PDF parsing are mature technologies
- Cloud infrastructure enables fluid experience

**Combines the best of multiple worlds:**
- Natural conversation of ChatGPT
- Professionalism of CV writing services
- Convenience of visual templates
- Specialized knowledge of recruiters

**Solves the complete problem, not just a part:**
- Other tools help with format OR content OR analysis
- AltocV2 integrates everything into one coherent workflow
- Reduces from 4-5 tools to just one
