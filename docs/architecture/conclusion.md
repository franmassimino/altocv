# Conclusion

This architecture document provides a comprehensive blueprint for building AltocV2 as a modern, serverless-first, AI-powered CV platform. The design prioritizes:

1. **Developer Experience:** Type-safe end-to-end, Server Actions eliminate boilerplate
2. **Cost Efficiency:** <$50/month operational costs with serverless scale-to-zero
3. **Performance:** Edge-first, optimistic UI, instant design preview
4. **AI Integration:** Vercel AI SDK with streaming, tool calling, generative UI
5. **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns, repository pattern, comprehensive testing

The architecture is designed to support rapid iteration during the 3-month MVP phase while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and scaling to 1000+ users.

**Next Steps:**
1. Initialize Next.js 15 project with shadcn/ui
2. Setup Neon database and Prisma schema
3. Implement authentication with NextAuth v5
4. Begin Epic 1 development (Foundation & Core Infrastructure)
